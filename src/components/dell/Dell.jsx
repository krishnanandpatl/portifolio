          <h1>Context and Background</h1>
          <p>
            FAP (Find a Partner Program) is a program by Dell that enables End
            Customers, Other Partners and Dell Sales Makers to engage with
            Dell's certified partners to solve their technology implementation
            challenges. The program helps partners to grow their business and
            also drives revenue growth for Dell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dell was facing challenges in increasing customer engagement with
            its partners through the FAP program and driving revenue growth for
            both Dell and its partners. Google Analytics data also revealed that
            the average time spent on the FAP program website was low,
            indicating a lack of customer interest and engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            To address these challenges, Dell decided to revamp the FAP program
            with a focus on improving the user experience and enhancing the
            visibility of Dell's product portfolio and the value proposition of
            the FAP program.

          <h1>What was the problem</h1>
          <div>
            The business challenge for Dell is to increase customer engagement
            with the FAP program and drive revenue growth for both Dell and its
            partners. This requires addressing the low traffic, poor user
            experience, and low conversion rates on the website.
          </div>
          <div>
            From a design perspective, the challenge is to create a
            user-friendly and visually appealing interface that simplifies the
            partner search process and enhances the visibility of Dell's product
            portfolio. This involves addressing pain points such as the poor
            user experience, high bounce rates, and low engagement.

          <p>
            When we were on-boarded to Dell FAP project, Dell had already
            conducted user research. So we began by analysing and synthesising
            the user research data collected which involved reviewing the
            existing experience and identifying key insights, pain points, and
            opportunities for improvement.

            <h1>Step #1: Understand the user</h1>
            <p>
              In the first phase, we identified end customers as the primary
              users, followed by partners, as they were the major contributors
              to the FAP program. The user research data was analysed, and a
              persona of the target users was created to identify their needs
              and pain points.

          Based on the problem prioritization, we conducted extensive research
          and gathered insights from stakeholders and users to gain a deeper
          understanding of the pain points and needs. This allowed us to define
          a clear problem statement that guided our ideation and
          solution-building process.

            How might we improve the process of connecting customers with the
            right Dell partners for their needs, in order to increase revenue
            growth for Dell and its partners and enhance the overall customer

            Once the problem statement was defined, we engaged in a
            brainstorming session using the crazy 8 exercise to generate
            multiple ideas. These ideas were then categorized into different
            groups to facilitate further analysis. We then plotted them on a 2x2
            Solution matrix to identify their properties and selected the most
            promising ones for further development.

              I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of user research
              and data analysis in driving design decisions. It was crucial to
              understand the pain points and motivations of our users to create
              a more engaging and efficient platform.

              Additionally, I learned about the importance of collaborating

              technically feasible and scalable.
