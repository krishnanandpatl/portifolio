          MoneyTap is a Bangalore-based fintech startup that provides users with
          an app-based credit line. The app allows users to borrow money on an
          as-needed basis, with low interest rates per month. MoneyTap has
          partnered with RBL Bank to provide credit lines to users, and the
          company has raised over $32 million in funding since its launch in
          2016. <br /> <br />
          The credit approval process for MoneyTap users is handled through the
          MoneyTap Bankerâ€™s Portal (MTBP). This portal is used by MoneyTap's
          partner banks and other financial institutions to assess and approve
          user credit applications. However, the complex nature of the credit
          approval process and the large number of stakeholders involved has
          made the MTBP system difficult to use, resulting in frustration for
          users and slower processing times. As a result, there is a need to
          improve the user experience and streamline the credit approval process
          to meet the demands of MoneyTap's growing user base.

              MoneyTap Banker's Portal (MTBP) was a complex and unintuitive
              system that provides a poor user experience. The overabundance of
              functions and elements within the system make it challenging for
              users to navigate and learn how to use effectively. <br /> <br />
              Additionally, the credit approval process is lengthy and
              inefficient due to multiple teams being involved in different
              stages of the process. <br /> <br />
              Miscommunication and errors can occur due to a lack of
              communication and coordination between the teams involved. The
              system also requires manual data entry and verification, which can
              be prone to errors and slows down the credit approval process.

              The MTBP platform was created with the goal of delivering a
              seamless user experience with a simple, intuitive interface that
              priorities quick and efficient credit disbursement. <br /> <br />
              To achieve this, I crafted a linear shared workspace with powerful
              user management capabilities that allow users to easily track the
              credit approval process from start to finish. <br /> <br />
              As a key component of the design, data security was carefully
              considered and implemented to ensure that user data is kept safe
              at all times.

          As part of my role in MTBP, I took on the responsibility of conducting
          comprehensive research to inform our product development strategy. To
          accomplish this, I drafted two research proposals, which included both
          secondary and primary research methods. <br /> <br />
          Research Goal: The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a
          deep understanding of the credit approval process and our various
          users/teams involved in the process. By doing so, I was able to
          identify opportunities to differentiate our product, and to develop a
          product that met the needs and expectations of our users.
