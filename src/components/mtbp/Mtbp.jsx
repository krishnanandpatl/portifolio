              MoneyTap is a Bangalore-based fintech startup that provides users
              with an app-based credit line. The app allows users to borrow
              money on an as-needed basis, with low interest rates per month.
              MoneyTap has partnered with RBL Bank to provide credit lines to
              users, and the company has raised over $32 million in funding
              since its launch in 2016.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The credit approval process for MoneyTap users is handled through
              the MoneyTap Banker’s Portal (MTBP). This portal is used by
              MoneyTap's partner banks and other financial institutions to
              assess and approve user credit applications. However, the complex
              nature of the credit approval process and the large number of
              stakeholders involved has made the MTBP system difficult to use,
              resulting in frustration for users and slower processing times. As
              a result, there is a need to improve the user experience and
              streamline the credit approval process to meet the demands of
              MoneyTap's growing user base.

                MoneyTap Banker's Portal (MTBP) was a complex and unintuitive
                system that provides a poor user experience. The overabundance
                of functions and elements within the system make it challenging
                for users to navigate and learn how to use effectively.

              </div>
              <div>
                Additionally, the credit approval process is lengthy and
                inefficient due to multiple teams being involved in different
                stages of the process.

                Miscommunication and errors can occur due to a lack of
                communication and coordination between the teams involved. The
                system also requires manual data entry and verification, which
                can be prone to errors and slows down the credit approval
                process.

                The MTBP platform was created with the goal of delivering a
                seamless user experience with a simple, intuitive interface that
                priorities quick and efficient credit disbursement.

              </div>
              <div>
                To achieve this, I crafted a linear shared workspace with
                powerful user management capabilities that allow users to easily
                track the credit approval process from start to finish.

              As part of my role in MTBP, I took on the responsibility of
              conducting comprehensive research to inform our product
              development strategy. To accomplish this, I drafted two research
              proposals, which included both secondary and primary research
              methods.

                  <h4>Secure Data Storage</h4>
                  <p>
                    The platform should have secure data storage features that
                    ensure customer data is kept safe and confidential.

                  <p>
                    The platform should be customisable and flexible to make
                    changes to the platform to meet the evolving needs of the
                    business and users.

              I analyzed the tasks and user flows that align with the needs,

              A Usability Test Guide was created and proposed after the
              finalisation of the high-fidelity prototype. Participants from
              various backgrounds were invited to test a click-through prototype
              and provide feedback based on their observations.
            </p>
            <strong>There were many valid and interesting suggestions:</strong>

                The streamlined workflow and clearer information hierarchy
                helped users to better understand the credit approval process
                and make more informed decisions.

              <div>
                <img src={oarrow} alt="" />
                The addition of real-time notifications and updates was
                particularly well-received, as users felt more informed and
                engaged with the platform and the status of their application.

              <div>
                <img src={oarrow} alt="" />
                Some users suggested the addition of more educational resources
                or FAQs to further clarify any questions or concerns they had
                about the platform or the credit approval process.

              <div>
                <img src={oarrow} alt="" />
                Some users expressed interest in more customisation options or
                personalised features to better tailor the platform to their
                individual needs or preferences.

                Overall, users were pleased with the revamp of MTBP and felt
                that it was a significant improvement over the previous version,
                making the credit approval process faster, more efficient, and
                more user-friendly.

              During my work on the credit approval platform project, I gained a
              deep understanding of the credit approval process and the fintech
              domain.

            <div className="flex items-baseline gap-[10px]">
              <img src={arrow} alt="" />I learned about the various stages
              involved in the process, including document verification, credit
              score analysis, physical document pickup, and address
              verification. I also learned about the importance of user
              experience in fintech platforms and how it can greatly impact user
              satisfaction and adoption.

              Future directions for MTBP could include incorporating more
              automation and AI to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the
              credit approval process, as well as expanding the platform to
              include additional financial products beyond credit lines.
