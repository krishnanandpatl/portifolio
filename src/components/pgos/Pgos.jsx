                My top priority was to understand the needs of users and develop

                  What is a Scenario: A scenario is a specific set of events or
                  conditions that may occur in the future, such as a change in
                  customer behaviour or a new competitor entering the market. In

                  possibilities and plan for the future.

                  <h5>Wire-framing</h5>
                  <p>
                    Once the solutions were finalised, I created wireframes for
                    each solution to visualise the layout and flow of the new
                    feature. I created wireframes using Adobe XD, ensuring they
                    were easy to understand for both the development team and
                    stakeholders.

                <div>
                  <h5>Validation</h5>
                  <p>
                    I review the solutions with the marketing team and
                    stakeholders to ensure that they accurately reflect the
                    goals and requirements of the project.

              accuracy and reliability.

              I appreciate your interest in seeing my work and I hope you can
              understand that my commitment to maintaining client trust and
              confidentiality is of the utmost importance to me. If there are
              any other ways in which I can demonstrate my skills and

              Due to the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) I have signed with PGOS,
              I am not able to showcase any design work publicly. However, I can
              confidently say that my design solutions have positively impacted
              the business and have contributed to improving the overall user
              experience.

                <h5>Resistance to Change</h5>
                <p>
                  Despite encountering resistance from clients to proposed
                  changes, I overcame this challenge by building trust,
                  effectively communicating the benefits of the changes, and
                  providing data to support my recommendations.

                <h5>Differing Design Opinion</h5>
                <p>
                  At times the client had different idea of what the final
                  design should look like, which resulted in conflicting design
                  opinions. To overcome this, you can present a clear rationale
                  for your design decisions and provide data and user research
                  to support your design choices.

                <p>
                  Sometimes client had technical constraints that limit the
                  design options available. To overcome this challenge, I would
                  work with the client to identify the technical constraints and
                  design a solution that works within those constraints.
