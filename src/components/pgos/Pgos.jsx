                change in customer behaviour or a new competitor entering the

                different possibilities and plan for the future.

                  Despite encountering resistance from clients to proposed

                  effectively communicating the benefits of the changes, and
                  providing data to support my recommendations.

                <p>
                  At times the client had different idea of what the final
                  design should look like, which resulted in conflicting design
                  opinions. To overcome this, you can present a clear rationale
                  for your design decisions and provide data and user research
                  to support your design choices.

                  Sometimes client had technical constraints that limit the

                  work with the client to identify the technical constraints and
                  design a solution that works within those constraints.

                  In managing UX tracks for projects, I have developed skills in
                  project management, including task prioritization, timeline
                  management, and effective communication with team members and
                  stakeholders.

                  Working with a variety of stakeholders, including program
                  managers, tech leads, business teams, and design teams, I have
                  learned how to effectively communicate design recommendations
                  and receive feedback for iterative design improvements.
