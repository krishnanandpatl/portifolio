              Hey there!
              <span className="whiteFontColor">
                &nbsp; I'm Kshitij Srivastava and I'm a UX designer currently
                living in Bengaluru.
              </span>
              But let me take you back to the beginning of my journey.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I was born and raised in the city of Kanpur, a bustling city in
              northern India. As a child, I always loved art and design, and
              spent many hours drawing and creating my own little sketches. When
              it was time for me to attend college, I decided to pursue my
              passion and study design at a college in Pune.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span className="whiteFontColor">During my time in Pune,</span> I
              learned a lot about various aspects of design, from graphic design
              to product design. However, it was during a course on user
              experience design that I found my true calling. I loved the idea
              of designing products and experiences that not only looked
              beautiful, but also worked seamlessly for users.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After college, I landed my first job in
              <span className="whiteFontColor">
                &nbsp; Mumbai as a junior designer
              </span>
              at a start-up. It was an exciting and challenging experience,as I
              worked on a variety of projects and had the opportunity to learn
              from more experienced designers. But, as time went on,I began to
              feel the itch for something new and exciting.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              That's when I packed my bags and
              <span className="whiteFontColor">
                &nbsp; headed to Bengaluru, the "Silicon Valley" of India.
              </span>
              I was ready to take on new challenges and learn as much as I
              could. Here, I worked for several years as a senior UX designer at
              a well-known tech company. I loved the fast-paced, innovative
              culture of Bengaluru, but I also felt that there was something
              missing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And then, came the opportunity of a lifetime a chance to
              <span className="whiteFontColor">
                &nbsp; travel to South Africa for work.
              </span>
              I was thrilled at the prospect of working as a UX designer in a
              new environment, and using my skills to create meaningful
              experiences for people from all over the world. It was a
              life-changing experience and made me realize that this was where I
              wanted to settle down and make a home.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But outside of work, I also have a passion for

              and capturing abandonment places taken over by nature, It was my
              way of exploring my creative side and appreciating the beauty of
              the world around us
