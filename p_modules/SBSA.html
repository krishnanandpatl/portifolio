          <p>
            Till Recently Standard Bank South Africa was using Legacy Interface
            for most of its offering which worked like magic. But this magic
            receded to a slew of disparate features that made the experience
            slow and complex to use. hence the need came to Migrate from Legacy
            interface to BOL (Business Online) Standard Bank.
          </p>
          <p>
            The product needed to cater to the needs of three distinct user
            groups

          <p>
            The goal of the project was to improve the overall user experience
            of Standard Bank BOL portal. The scope of the project involved
            conducting user research and testing to understand user needs,
            suggesting design solutions, and testing those solutions to create a
            more intuitive and user-friendly module.

          <p>
            While this project was part of a larger effort to improve the
            overall banking experience for business users. It should be noted
            that this case study will only discuss the consolidated balances
            module and not the entire Standard Bank BOL portal redesign project.

          <p>
            To provide Standard Bank's business customers with a streamlined and
            user-friendly way to view and manage their balances. By reducing the
            time it takes for customers to complete balance-related tasks,
            increasing customer satisfaction and improving the accuracy of
            balance reporting.

            How might we improve the Consolidated Balances module in the BOL
            portal making it easy for users to add and remove accounts, edit
            subgroups, and select balance types, while ensuring that the process
            is intuitive and clear, regardless of the user's level of financial
            expertise?

        <div class="solution-sbsa">
          <h1>The Solution</h1>
          <p>
            We simplified the navigation by placing consolidated balances on the
            level 1 navigation and introduced search and refresh options
            prominently.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also included all account subgroups at level 2 to reduce
            cognitive load. As a result, user testing showed that 18
            participants found the new navigation and search features helpful in
            locating consolidated balances within a minute.

            We started by conducting user interviews and testing of the legacy

              The aim of this usability report is to assess the effectiveness

              portal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Methodology: Participants were assigned a set of 5 tasks to
              perform using the consolidated statement feature, such as adding
              and deleting accounts, adding subgroups, editing subgroup
              selections, and choosing balance types. During the process,
              participants were observed and asked to articulate their thought
              process out loud. Upon completion, participants were asked to
              provide feedback on their experience using the feature.

                  Based on the results of the usability testing, the
                  consolidated statement feature is not user-friendly and

          potential areas for improvement. Through this evaluation, we were able
          to identify several critical issues that needed to be addressed to
          improve the overall user experience.

          <h3>Step #1: Brainstorming</h3>
          <p>
            We used SCAMPER a Creative Thinking Technique to generate ideas for
            improving the Consolidated Balances feature of BOL. The Scamper
            report below outlines the different areas that we examined and the
            ideas that we generated.
          </p>

          <div>
            The results of the SCAMPER technique led to the generation of
            numerous innovative ideas for improving the consolidated balances
            feature of BOL.We applied the Substitute and Combine techniques to
            the Consolidated Balances feature of BOL.
          </div>
          <div>
            We substituted the current static interface with a dynamic one that
            updates in real-time, combining it with a feature that allows users
            to set alerts for certain account activity.

          <h3>Step #2: Categorized Ideas</h3>
          <p>
            We found that many of the ideas generated fell under the theme of
            improving the interface's functionality and customization options.
            Some examples of ideas that emerged from the brainstorming sessions
            include:

          <div>
            <h5>Simplification of Navigation and Information Architecture</h5>
            <p>
              Simplifying the navigation of the feature to make it more
              intuitive and user-friendly.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Visualisation and Presentation</h5>

              Introducing interactive graphs to visualise account activity over

          </div>
          <div>
            <h5>Recommendation and Suggestion</h5>
            <p>
              Adding a feature that recommends actions to take based on account
              balances and spending patterns.

          </div>
          <div>

            <p>
              Allowing users to set and customise alerts for specific account
              activity, such as when a transaction exceeds a certain amount or
              when a bill payment is due.

          <h3>Step #3: Prioritization</h3>
          <p>
            We then used SCAMPER brainstorming exercises to generate ideas and
            categorised them based on common themes. From these, we prioritised
            the top ideas, including:
          </p>
          <div>
            <h5>Simplification of Navigation and Information Architecture</h5>
            <p>
              This idea was prioritised because it addresses a fundamental issue
              with the feature's usability, which was a significant pain point
              for users during testing. By making it easier for users to find
              and understand the information they need, we can improve the
              overall user experience.

          <p>
            After the ideation sessions, we conducted a thorough analysis of the
            existing IA and information flow of the platform.
          </p>
          <h4>User Workflow</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As a result of ideation sessions and input from users and
              business, we simplified the IA and improved the information flow
              and user flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user flow has been optimised, with intuitive paths that make
              it easier for users to complete tasks efficiently. With the
              reduced clicks to perform actions, users can accomplish their
              tasks faster, which improves their overall experience with the
              platform.

            After conducting multiple brainstorming sessions, we shifted our
            focus towards finding solutions to the challenges faced by users
            while navigating and locating menus on the platform. Following a few
            iterations, we finalised on two approaches to tackle these issues,
            which are:
          </p>
          <div>
            <div>
              <h4>Approach #1</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We suggested putting the consolidated balances feature in the
                  level 1 of the navigation, along with Accounts, Balances, Find
                  a Transaction and Download Report.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Additionally, we recommended including All Account and
                  Accounts Subgroups under the Accounts tab at level 2, along
                  with search and refresh options that are prominently displayed
                  on the page.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h5>Impact:</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Approach 1 reduces cognitive load and improve decision-making
                  for the user. By organising the information architecture in a
                  clear and intuitive manner, users can quickly find the
                  information they need and make informed decisions about their
                  finances.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The search and refresh options also provide users with easy
                  ways to filter and update the data, further enhancing the
                  usability of the feature.

            <h3>Approach #2</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                we have added prominent print, export, and consolidate CTAs
                upfront on the page, making them easily accessible to users
                without requiring them to search for these options.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Impact:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Approach 2 aims to reduce the cognitive load and decision-making
                effort required by users by providing them with easy access to
                the most important and commonly used features.
              </li>
              <li>
                We reduced the number of steps required for users to perform
                these actions frequently, which not only saved them time but
                also aligns with their mental model of where these options
                should be located on the page.

          To ensure success in a project of this size, it is crucial for the
          entire team to be involved throughout the process, sharing their
          research findings, discussing roadblocks, and working together towards
          achieving common goals that address both user needs and business
          objectives.

          Although we are still evaluating the results based on key performance

          Above all, this project provided me with the opportunity to work with

          If I had more time, I would definitely explore the possibilities of
          the "Trigger mechanism" even further. This mechanism plays an
          important role in automatically generating a case based on certain
          triggers, and I believe there is more room for innovation and
          improvement in this area.

          Additionally, I would like to add more flexibility to the system to
          accommodate cross-functional users whose goals may not be solely
          focused on case closure. By doing so, we can ensure that the system
          meets the needs of a wider range of users and can be used in various
          contexts.
