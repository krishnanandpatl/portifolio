            <p>
              The Idea of Trippiez was coined by a group of travel enthusiasts
              who wanted to help others discover new and unfamiliar travel
              destinations based on their budget. As X-IITians from Madras, they
              knew the joys of travel and adventure, but also recognised that
              many people were unable to experience the same due to financial
              constraints.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The project ask was to design and develop a user-centred website
              that would enable users to discover new travel destinations based
              on their budget and then book air tickets and hotel accommodation
              on the same platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal was to create a website that would provide users with a
              seamless and personalised travel experience, tailored to their
              individual preferences and financial constraints.

              We conduct both primary and secondary research to gain a deeper
              understanding of the target audience and the competitive
              landscape. Primary research involves collecting new data directly
              from users through surveys, interviews, or observations.

            <br />
            <p>
              By conducting primary research, I can gain firsthand information
              about users' needs, behaviors, and pain points, which allows me to
              develop more effective design solutions that meet their specific
              needs.

              I conducted a competitive analysis to gain insights into the
              strengths and weaknesses of our competitors in the travel

              where we can improve and areas where we are already ahead of the

              We conducted thorough research and gathered insights from our
              users. Next, we defined experience principles that aligned with
              the business pillars of the project to guide the design of
              Trippiez. This approach ensured that the product catered to the
              needs of both users and the business.

            Working on the Trippiez project, I gained valuable experience in
            designing for the travel and hospitality industry. I learned how to
            incorporate features that address the specific needs of travelers,
            such as search filters for budget and location, personalized
            recommendations, and social sharing capabilities.

            There are several potential future directions for Trippiez that
            could help it continue to grow and succeed. One direction would be
            to focus on expanding the range of travel options available on the
            platform, such as offering more off-the-beaten-path destinations and
            unique travel experiences.

          <br />
          <div className="flex items-baseline gap-[10px]">
            <img src={arrow} alt="" />
            Trippiez could include expanding the platform to offer more unique
            and immersive travel experiences, integrating augmented or virtual
            reality features to enhance trip planning and preview, implementing
            a loyalty or rewards program to incentivize repeat usage, and
            continuing to prioritize sustainability and eco-friendly options for
            environmentally conscious users.
